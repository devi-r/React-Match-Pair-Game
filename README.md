# React Match Pair Game

Create a memory matching game where players flip cards to find matching pairs in a 4x4 grid (8 pairs total).  
The game should track flips, matches, and moves, and provide visual feedback during gameplay.

## Requirements

### 1. Card Grid

- Render a 4x4 grid (total 16 cards).
- Each card hides a **number** initially.
- Use numbers **1 to 8**, each repeated twice.
- Randomly shuffle numbers on every game start/reset.

---

### 2. Card Behavior

- When a card is clicked:
  1. Reveal the number.
  2. Only two cards can be revealed at a time.
- If the two revealed cards **match**, they stay visible (marked as matched).
- If they **donâ€™t match**, flip them back after a 1-second delay.
- Disable user interaction during this 1-second delay.

---

### 3. Game Logic

- Track and display the number of **moves** (every two flips = one move).
- When all pairs are matched:  
  Show a **ðŸŽ‰ You won!** message.

---

### 4. Reset Button

- Provide a **Reset** button to restart the game:
  1. Shuffle the numbers.
  2. Reset the move counter.
  3. Hide all cards.
  4. Clear any matched state or win message.
